LittleBanking
==========
This is an example project (created 2+ years ago) that demonstrates how to organize by feature. Most of the code is in the *LittleBanking.Features* project.

Each feature is organized into sub-folders only when necessary. When there is a single file or just a small # of files or when all of the files would belong into one __category__ then it isn't necessary to sub-divide any further. You'll notice this with the Public and Error features which only contain the controller and routes.

Features
=======

Users\
--------
This handles the route, controller, models and validations around users. You can find the views, css and javascript in the main site project.
